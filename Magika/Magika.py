# Intro to command


# Game idea is to have wizards fight each other using 8 elements:
    # Each wizard would combine two elements which then would fire the combined spell towards the other wizard
    # Certain spells would cancel and/or defeat others (The thinking here is to creat something roughly rock/paper/scissors)
        # Create elements list which could be referenced
        # Create combination list?
